Daemonize a command and e-mail the results

``daemail`` (pronounced "DEE-mayl", like "e-mail" but with a D) is a Python
script for running a normally-foreground command in the background and
e-mailing its output (by default, the combined stdout and stderr) once it's
done.

Run ``daemail --help`` or visit <https://github.com/jwodder/daemail> for more
information.
